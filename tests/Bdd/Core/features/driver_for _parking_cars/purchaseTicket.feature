Feature: Purchase ticket

  AS
  a car driver

  I WANT TO
  purchase a ticket for parking the car at a zone during a period of time

  SO THAT
  I can park the car without being fined

  @wip
  Scenario: At orange zone paying for 2 hours

    Given there are the following rates at rate repository:
      | name        | amountPerHour |
      | ORANGE_ZONE | 0.95          |

    And next available ticket code is "0000000001"

    And there is no ticket with code "0000000001" at ticket repository

    And the payment is valid

    When I do the following purchase ticket request:
      | carPlate | rateName    | clock            | amount | paymentCard      |
      | 6989JJH  | ORANGE_ZONE | 2022/05/11 10:00 | 1.90   | 5200828282828210 |

    Then I should obtain the ticket code "0000000001"

    And there should be the following ticket at ticket repository:
      | code       | carPlate | rateName    | startingDateTime | endingDateTime   | price |
      | 0000000001 | 6989JJH  | ORANGE_ZONE | 2022/05/11 10:00 | 2022/05/11 12:00 | 1.90  |

    And next available ticket code should be "0000000002"

    And the following pay request should have been done to payment service:
      | ticketCode | paymentCard      | amount |
      | 0000000001 | 5200828282828210 | 1.90   |

    And no PayErrorException should have been thrown
