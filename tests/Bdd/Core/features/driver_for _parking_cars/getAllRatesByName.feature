Feature: Get all rates by name

  AS
  a car driver

  I WANT TO
  get the available rates in the city indexed by name

  SO THAT
  I can choose the rate name of the zone I want to park the car at

  @wip
  Scenario: BLUE, GREEN and ORANGE rates

    Given there are the following rates at rate repository:
      | name        | amountPerHour |
      | BLUE_ZONE   | 0.80          |
      | ORANGE_ZONE | 0.95          |
      | GREEN_ZONE  | 1.20          |

    When I ask for getting all rates by name

    Then I should obtain the following rates indexed by name:
      |             | name        | amountPerHour |
      | BLUE_ZONE   | BLUE_ZONE   | 0.80          |
      | GREEN_ZONE  | GREEN_ZONE  | 1.20          |
      | ORANGE_ZONE | ORANGE_ZONE | 0.95          |
